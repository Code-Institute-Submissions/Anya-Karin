#H1 Anya Karin singer song writer

<p>This project aims to promote the identity and work of Anya Karin as a singer and song writer. The current music market understands that to achieve popularity, the songs should reach the consumer repeatedly in order to create familiarity as Duhigg explains in "The Power of Habit". At this moment in time, radio is losing its place as top gatekeeper of what songs reach the mass audience, giving way to platforms such as spotify and apple play.</p>
<p>As the trends favour the streaming market that had a rise from 76.8 million users in 2015 to 278 million users in 2019. Therefore, an online presence is vital in order to reach listeners. A website that contains enough information to convey the artist's identity and work would become the home of the digital image and the link to different social and streaming platforms used by the artist.</p>


<h2>UX</h2

<p>Anya Karin is a singer / song writer is based in Lisbon and sings pop music both in Portuguese and English.</p>
<p>The ideal consumer will be population that uses music streaming subscribers and youtube listeners that choose pop playlist</p>
<p>The ideal consumer will costumise playlist as it becomes familiar with the artist. The website aims to provide a clean, professional image to the fan and future fan that wishes to find out more about the artist."

<p>The artist has youtube presence and presence on streaming platforms, as well as on social media However the current website lacks creative design. This project aims to correct that problem.</p>

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
