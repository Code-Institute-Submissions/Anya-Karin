# Anya Karin singer song writer

This project aims to promote the identity and work of Anya Karin as a singer and song writer. The current music market understands that to achieve popularity, the songs should reach the consumer repeatedly in order to create familiarity as Duhigg explains in "The Power of Habit".  
At this moment in time, radio is losing its place as top gatekeeper between music and the audience, giving way to platforms such as spotify and apple play.  
As the trends favour the streaming market that had a rise from 76.8 million users in 2015 to 278 million users in 2019. Therefore, an online presence is vital in order to reach listeners. A website that contains enough information to convey the artist's identity and work would become the home of the digital image and the link to different social and streaming platforms used by the artist.</p>


## UX

Anya Karin is a singer / song writer with base in Lisbon singing pop music both in Portuguese and English.

### Ideal consumer:
  * The ideal consumer will be part of the population of music streaming subscribers and youtube listeners that chooses pop playlist
  * The ideal uses daily youtube and streaming platforms to listen to music and costumises their playlists playing favourit artists repeatedly.   

 ### Project aims: 
  * The website aims to provide a clean, professional image to the fans and future fans that wish to find out more about the artist.  
  * The artist has youtube presence and presence on streaming platforms, as well as on social media. However the current website lacks creative design. This project aims to correct that problem so it becomes user friendly.
  * The end aim on the website is to promote a professional image, increase number of listeners, followers and sales.

 ### Strategy:  
  The strategy includes to promote the visualization of youtube videos and purchase of the songs. It also includes the oportunity of the consumer to contact the artist to hire for gigs and events.

### Structure:  
  The webstite contains 5 pages (initially thought of 4: Home, Music, About, Contact, but soon realised that needed to separate videos and song lists on music page).
(to include wireframes)


### Scope:
Content requirement:  
     - About page (consumer to find out about the artist)  
     - Store (maybe wwithin a music page - to enable sales)
     - links to social media pages
     - listen and play button and videos for access to the songs and increase familiarity


### Features
  * "carousel" - with artist photos, highlighting song name with link to page where the consumer can stream or buy the song.  
     This feature is found the on the home page.
  
  * Navigation bar - on the top of the page it is presented a navigation bar with logo and links to all pages.  
     This feature is presented in all pages and is responsive to all screen sizes;

  * Social media links - on every footer and presented with the social media icon.
     These links will offer the opportunity to links with the artist social media.
     
  * Youtube videos - the 5 videos with most views on youtube will be presented in the video page.

  * Songs list - A list of all the artist songs with the icon to buy and play a sample of the music.  
     This list wwill be on the music page and at this stage the icons to play sample and to buy will not be functional.

  * Submit form - with place to submit request to hire artist for events / gigs.  
     This form will be on the contact form and at this stage will not be submitting data to a recipient.
     In future would like to add a live chat where the consumer can be given the opportunity to message and have a reply instantly when the artist is online.

The languages used in this project were HTML and CSS
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
